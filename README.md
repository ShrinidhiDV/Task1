Subject: Real Estate Web Application Development with Dynamic Pages

Dear Geminas Ket,

Thank you for reaching out!

I'm SHRINIDHI, and I’d be happy to assist with the functionality setup for your real estate website. Based on your requirements, we’ll create four dynamic pages: one each for apartments, houses, business centres, and land, with two connected filters for sale and rent. This will ensure a functional and streamlined user experience.

Given the budget constraints, please let me know if you’d like to discuss further to align the requirements with your budget of $100000.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
SHRINIDHI
